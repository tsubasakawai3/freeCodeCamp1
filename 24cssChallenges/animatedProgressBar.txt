Requirements
・Build a CSS animation of a progress bar filling to 100%. The animation
  should run continuously, with a small pause when the bar is filled 100%
・The progress begins red, turns blue at 50% full, and green when complete
・CSS only

Hints
・It may help to think of the progress bar as two elements, one on top of
  another: an outer progress bar and an inner progress bar. How can you use
  the width of the inner progress bar to create the effect of the outer progress
  bar filling?
・Use the animation property and keyframes to complete this challenges.
  There's no way to pause an infinite animation between iterations,
  so to create the effect of a "pause" once the progress bar has filled to 100%,
  you may need to extra key frame
