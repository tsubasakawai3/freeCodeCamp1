Requirements
・Search input
    - Takes up 1/3 of the width of its container

・When the user clicks into the search bar:
    - Input grows to entire width of its parent
    container with smooth transition
    - Shrinks back to original size when user clicks away
    - Blue boarder
    - Bonus: placeholder text is not visible when
    user clicks inside the search bar

・Accessibility
    - For accessibility, form inputs should always have a label.
    Create a label with a valid "for" attribute
    - Look up some CSS rules (no need to write it yourself)
    that hide the search input's label visually but keeps it accessible to screen readers.

Hint and Help
・Use a transition to make sure the search bar expands smoothly

What to Research:
・The :focus pseudo selector
・A pseudo selector that lets you change placeholder styles
