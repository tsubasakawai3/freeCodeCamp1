Requirements
Instagram "stories" are slideshows of photos, memes, and text.
Each element in the example represents a user who has posted a story.
The state of each story is communicated visually via the color of its
border. Create 3 classes that can be added to the .story element to visually
indicate the state of each story:

・.new - add gradient border to show story has NOT yet been viewed
・.viewed - adds grey border to show story has been viewed
・.live - adds red notification badge, to show user is currently live streaming

Hints
・A gradient border effect can be accomplished using a wrapping div (note
  that the border-image property will not work properly with border radius)
・How you add the "LIVE" badge if that text doesn't already exist in the DOM?
  Trying using a pseudo element and the content property
