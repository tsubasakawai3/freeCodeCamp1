Requirements
・The HTML for the graph is generated by the code in index.js. You don't
  need to worry about how the code works (unless you want to!).
・The graph has 7 squares in each column, representing each day of the week,
  and 52 squares in each row, representing each week of the year.
・Style the graph with defalut squares. Then create selectors that will
  style each square based on the number of contributions per day. The JS code
  randomely each square a contirbution level of 0, 3, 5, or 10, which is 
  assigned using a data property. The lighter the color, the greater the number
  of contributions for that day.

Hints
・This challenge is a really great candidate for CSS grid and the repeat() funciton
・ For styling the squares, look into using attribute selectors
