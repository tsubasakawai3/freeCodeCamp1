Requirements
・Card has two sides, and flips from front to back on hover
・Match styles as closely as you can
・CSS only
・Don't worry about responsiveness

Hints:
・A card flip is essentially an element rotatin 180 degrees in 3D space.
  Use .card class to create the flip effect, then show and hide the front
  and back content as the card flips
・Use the transition property for a smooth flip
・The CSS properties transform-style:
  preserve-3d and backface-visibility will help you along the way
