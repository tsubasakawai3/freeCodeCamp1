Requirements
Build a progress bar that you can change by swapping classes.
Style a class for each of the progress bar's stages:

・Stage 1: 25% finished
・Stage 2: 50% finished
・Stage 3: 75% finished
・Stage 4: 100% finished

Hint:
It may help to think of the progress bar as two elements, one on top of
another: an outer progress bar and an inner progress bar. How can you use 
the width of the inner progress bar to create the effect of the outer progress bar filling?
